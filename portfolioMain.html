    Born into a lower-middle class latino family in Boston, I lived a fulfilling and happy childhood. While in school I struggled with academics, and would constantly get into fights with other students, I was lucky enough to have fantastic teachers nearly the entire way through (with the occasional exception here and there). Throughout my childhood, videogames had always been a major part in my life. I first picked up a controller when I was only 4 years old, and playing games that I was far too young for, like Left 4 Dead and Halo 3. Growing up, I had the usual answers most kids my age (5-10) would have when asked about what kind of job I wanted. "I wanted to be in the army" or "I want to be a race car driver." As I grew older, however, I began to realize just how passionate I was about videogames, and by the time I was around 14, I understood that I wanted to become a Videogame Developer. Despite this desire, I did rather poorly in most computer classes I took, due to the fact that they were generally dull, mind-numbing, and all around uninteresting, as it was either very basic HTML, or typing tests. However, once I got into Madison Park Technical Vocational High School, this changed. I was going to a school where I could properly pursue coding! Not only that, but the teachers in the CPWD vocation were fantastic. They didn't feel like proper "teachers" but more like  mentors who I could (and did) have a more casual relationship with. Along with this, these people were clearly passionate to teach coding and web development, and it showed.

<p id="text3">In the future, I aim to become a successful Video Game Developer. While I don't expect to be the next Toby Fox (Developer behind Undertale), or Edmund Mcmillen (Developer behind The Binding of Issac), I do believe that I have the ideas in mind, and the materials to draw inspiration from to make a game that hundreds, thousands, and maybe even tens of thousands of people will be able to enjoy, and they themselves be inspired by. I'm well aware of the many pitfalls I may run into on this journey, but I firmly believe that I will be able to overcome them, no matter how numerous or challenging they may be.</p>
