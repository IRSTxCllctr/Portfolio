    Born into a lower-middle class latino family in Boston, I lived a fulfilling and happy childhood. While in school I struggled with academics, and would constantly get into fights with students, I was lucky enough to have fantastic teachers nearly the entire way through (with the occasional exception here and there). Throughout my childhood, videogames had always been a major part in my life. I first picked up a controller when I was only 4 years old, and playing games that I was far too young for, like Left 4 Dead and Halo 3. Growing up, I had the usual answers most kids my age would have (5-10) when asked about what kind of job I wanted. "I wanted to be in the army" or "I want to be a race car driver." As I grew older, however, I began to realize just how passionate I was about videogames, and by the time I was around 14, I understood that I wanted to become a Videogame Developer. Despite this desire, I did rather poorly in most computer classes I took, due to the fact that they were generally dull, mind-numbing, and all around uninteresting, as it was either very basic HTML, or typing tests. However, once I got into Madison Park Technical Vocational High School, this changed. I was going to a school where I could properly pursue coding! Not only that, but the teachers in the CPWD vocation were fantastic. They didn't feel like proper "teachers" but more like  mentors who I could (and did) have a more casual relationship with. Along with this, these people were clearly passionate to teach coding and web development, and it showed.
